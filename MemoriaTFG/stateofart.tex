\section{Machine Learning}
In 1959, Arthur Samuel defined machine learning as a "Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed"\cite{arthursamuel}In 1955 John McCarthy defined artificial intelligence as \cite{johnmccarthy}, "the science and engineering of making intelligent machines". One of the basic behaviours of intelligence is the skill of learning. Therefore, machine learning is one of the main branches of artificial intelligence and, indeed, one of the most  developing branches on AI.  

The learning process is done by extracting meaning information from not structured data by building models and generalizing. This is why statistic play a big role in machine
